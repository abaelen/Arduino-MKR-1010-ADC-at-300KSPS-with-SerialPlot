# Arduino-MKR-1010-ADC-at-300KSPS-with-SerialPlot
Code to run Arduino MKR1010 ADC at 300KSPS with serialPlot

This code configures the ADC of the SAMD21G of the Arduino MKR1010 Wifi board, to run at max speed (350KSPS).
With this code an optimal serial transfer is realized towards SerialPlot to record and visualize 300KSPS on computer.
